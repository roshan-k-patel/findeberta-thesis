The chief investment strategist highlighted in a note on Monday that December's returns may be subpar given how well major indexes have performed in November. On November 24, the stock market hit a ""three-way all time high"" with the Dow, S&P 500, and Russell 2000 all hitting new records. Stovall said that this three-way high has only occurred 200 times since the Russell 2000's inception in 1979, and each time following the event, stock market gains have remained flat. In the 22 days following the three-way high, the S&P 500 has recorded a flat price change, compared to the average gain of 0.71%, said Stovall. The benchmark index rose in price only half of the time following this market event, versus the typical 63% frequency of advance, he added.
