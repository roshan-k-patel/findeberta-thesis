But Wharton's Jeremy Siegel said Friday that investors shouldn't be concerned that it's too much too soon for the stock market. In a Friday CNBC interview, the professor of finance laid out three factors that have supported the market's record-setting rally and will send stocks higher in 2021. The first is the record amount of liquidity from investors that's been held back by the coronavirus, Siegel said. ""I don't just mean reserves added by the Federal Reserve, I mean the M1 money supply, up 44% since the beginning of March. We have not seen that since World War II,"" Siegel said. The second factor—better-than-expected vaccine progress—will enable lead investors to unleash pent up liquidity and increase spending next year as the economy reopens, he added. Lastly, the outcome of the US election will help stocks in 2021, as a likely Republican-controlled Senate will put a cap on tax increases, while president-elect Joe Biden will avoid ""some of the crazy trade policies"" that President Trump pursued, the professor added.",Business Insider,"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 10:53:02 -0500",,Positive,Article
