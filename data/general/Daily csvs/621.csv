In a Thursday CNBC interview, he revealed his strategy is to emulate Warren Buffett and think long-term when buying stocks. ""If you think with a perspective of moving forward it allows you to make better decisions, Rogers said. ""These companies were getting crushed during the height of the pandemic, people didn't believe in them, and it was an opportunity to buy some extraordinary brands at bargain prices."" Among those ""extraordinary"" brands he scooped up is Vail Resorts, which has surged over 115% since March. Rogers said he purchased shares of the ski giant when other investors were nervous that the resort would never bounce back. Rogers believes Vail Resorts will bounce back faster than most leisure companies because skiing is already a socially distanced activity, and skiers wear masks usually by default. The investor also purchased dental corporation Envista Holdings in March, under the logic that a pandemic wouldn't stop people from seeking dental care. He called Envista a ""long, long term winner,"" and believes it has more upside following its nearly 180% rally since March.",Business Insider,"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 14:29:41 -0500",,Positive,Article
