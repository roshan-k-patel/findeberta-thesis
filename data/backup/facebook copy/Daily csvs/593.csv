Additionally, more brands are pulling ad spend from Facebook for the month of July in support of #StopHateForProfit, a campaign sponsored by nonprofits like the NAACP in protest of what they call Facebook's failure to remove hate speech and misinformation from its platform. While these moves are unlikely to make a dent in Facebook's ad business, the campaign's potentially broad uptake could lead to more pressure from consumers in the future about companies' ad spending practices.",Business Insider,"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 22:01:00 -0500",,Positive,Article,FB
