The Senate Judiciary Committee scheduled the hearing following a New York Post story, published on October 14 about Joe Biden's son, which contained dubious claims that Hunter Biden was working with Ukrainian officials. Twitter and Facebook's handling of the article fueled the right's ongoing, oft-disproven theory that the tech industry discriminates against conservative content on their platforms, a notion that President Donald Trump has amplified since Twitter began fact-checking his posts in May. Republican lawmakers will likely grill the tech leaders over what they say is censorship of right-leaning posts.",Business Insider,"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 14:36:24 -0500",CEO,Negative,Article,"FB,TWTR"
