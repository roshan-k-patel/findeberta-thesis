Last week, Beijing's State Administration for Market Regulation announced the launch of an antitrust investigation against Alibaba. Chinese finance regulators also summoned Ant Group to discuss its compliance processes, per The Wall Street Journal. The Ant crackdown comes after the company had to halt its $37 billion IPO in November due to micro-lending rules in China. ""The Ant Financial IPO delay and further regulatory crackdown is a major black eye for the Chinese tech sector and thus cast a shadow over the space with Alibaba front and center,"" Ives' team wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. The senior tech analyst said that this regulatory crackdown, coupled with the incoming US administration, will create a ""nirvana set up"" for FAANG stocks and the overall US tech sector in 2021. ",Business Insider,"Tue, 29 Dec 2020 11:08:28 -0500",paylimitwall,Positive,Article,"AAPL,AMZN,FB,GOOG,GOOGL,NFLX"
